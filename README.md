# **Terms[^1]** {#terms}

**Chance** \- In this case, we will use the term to talk about the universe coming into being by “chance”. Chance is a mathematical expression used to indicate the probability or likelihood of a particular thing happening or being the case.

**Properly Basic Belief** \- Properly (justified) Basic (not inferred from other beliefs) Belief. In the context of this paper, it will be used to justify the belief in God without requiring an explanation or further justification.

**Epistemology** \- The theory of knowledge; the study of *how* we come to know things.

**Ontology** \- The study of what exists and what does not.

**Axiology** \- The study of *value* (things like aesthetics and ethics).

**Necessary** \- The property of being required in order for something to exist (in this case, everything to exist).

**Contingent** \- The property of being dependent on, or caused by something external to itself. It can be defined by three things:

1. That which is explained by something external to it.  
2. That which depends on something external to it.  
3. That which can fail to exist.

**Necessary Being** \- A being whose existence is necessary for everything else to exist. It can be defined by these three things: 

1. That which explains itself and is known through itself.  
2. That which depends on itself and nothing external.  
3. That which cannot fail to exist.

# **Introduction** {#introduction}

بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

This paper serves as a killer of doubt for both me and whoever reads this. Atheism is growing and becoming more widespread, and is becoming apparent in both implicit and explicit ways. 

# **Postulates and Axioms of the Athari** {#postulates-and-axioms-of-the-athari}

# 

It is of utmost importance that I should clarify what the position of the Salafi/Atharis are when speaking about metaphysical and epistemological topics that can easily stray one away from proper Islamic belief. Here are some things to note:

1. Naql (text) precedes Aql (intellect). It is by the very nature of the origin of the Qur’an that you will not understand some things, but that is because you are not supposed to. If you try to use your intellect where it is not meant to be used, you will end up straying from the belief of the people of the sunnah.   
2. The Fitrah (natural human constitution; innate disposition; natural inclination) exists, and account for all epistemic axioms and provide the foundation for many beliefs and belief in general, such as: 

   a) The external world exists outside of one’s mind.  
   b) Morality as a whole, even if one is a moral nihilist/anti-realist who denies its existence.  
   c) The existence of one’s own identity.  
   d) The belief that our reasoning is trustable.  
   e)

Tactics used by Atheists (and non-muslims in general) in an attempt to “refute” Islam:

These are the polemic tactics, assessing each of their arguments against these points will lead us to answer any allegation or lie in a profound manner.

1- Taking a single Ayah or a Hadith in isolation from the rest of Islamic rubric (rest of the Quran and other Hadiths).

2- Isolating an Ayah or a Hadith from its context.

3- Ignoring the fact that not all Hadiths are authentic; infact some are termed as weak and some even as fabrication by Muhaddithin (Masters of the Sciences of Hadith).

4- Extensive use of the traditions from history books like those of Al-Tabari, Ibn Ishaaq and Ibn Sa'ad etc which contain raw material about early Muslims and include numerous unauthentic narrations. In fact, their compilers didn't take the amount of care as is done in Hadith compilations. (Scholars did their best either not to narrate unauthentic narrations or to mention their weakness when they dealt with narrations of legal and juristic importance but not so with those merely of historical import).

5- Disregard to the fact that not all the narrations that may have connected chains of trustworthy narrators serve as  
evidence. One needs to take into account what other narrators relate about the same issue and compare with different  
narrations before making an inference or deduction.

6- Indifference to the delicacies and subtleties of the Arabic language. A single word or phrase may have quite different meanings in different contexts.

7- Not understanding the peculiar environment and culture of 7th A.C. Arabia especially when it comes to the life of the Holy Prophet (pbuh) and his companions.

8- Ignoring the fact that it's the Arabic text of the Qur'an and Hadiths that matters and not the translations and commentaries.

9- 'Overlooking' the fact that when it comes to explanation and commentary, no single or a certain group of scholars is an absolute authority in the House of Islam. Opinion of any scholar, however erudite, may be rejected or ignored subject to valid reasons.

10- Referring to the deeds of ordinary Muslims and putting the blame on Islam. Such an attitude is absolutely wrong. Only the deeds of the Holy Prophet (pbuh), understood in the right context, represent the Islamic Faith. What if we see the Christian religion in light of the doings of the likes of Hitler?

Never engage in a debate or discussion without perfecting your character and understanding proper manners.

# **Claims from Atheists, Responses From a Muslim** {#claims-from-atheists,-responses-from-a-muslim}

1. Claim: God is a manmade construct to cope with hardship, implement rules in societies and to make sense of a universe that is absurd.  
     
   Response: Man has no play in whether or not God exists. You can reasonably come to a conclusion that God exists by necessity. Your claim presupposes that the universe lacks meaning in the first place—It is a properly basic belief that things have objective meaning. 

Before we respond to this claim, it is important to note that *most religions have been altered through manmade intervention and corruption.* That being said, our claim to the atheist is that Islam is the only uncorrupted religion that remains preserved by Allah. 

When the Atheist makes the claim mentioned in this thread, we will take it as 'being applicable to Islam' since they are making a general statement. 

Now, to answer the doubt:

To assert that religion is purely a man-made construct falls under an argument from ignorance, since you are making a categorical assertion that *it is the case* that religion, in its entirety including Islam, is purely man-made when the nature of the statement is conjectural. Most atheists would consider the proposition that God exists to be unknowable (some form of agnosticism). Note that there are **rarely** any atheists that actually view it to be impossible for God to exist. 

Also note that the argument from evil is not an argument \*against God\*. rather it is supposed to be an argument against an omnibenevolent god (claims usually made by 'abrahamic' religions). 

Deism would still be tenable if the argument from evil were true.

How *do* we disprove this claim? There are many ways to do so, including general and specific proofs:

1\) From the general proofs is to prove that God exists in general. These can be formulated using the following arguments:

\- Contingency/Cosmological arguments  
\- Teleological/Design arguments  
\- Noological arguments (arguments from consciousness)  
\- Nomological arguments (arguments from the laws of nature, similar to teleological arguments)  
\- Moral arguments  
\- Ontological arguments  
\- Modal arguments (usually not on its own, but paired with another field like epistemology or ontology)

If all religions were truly manmade, what does that entail for the atheistic worldview? Quite a few things:

1\) Morality would be nonexistent, since moral facts would have no truth makers and moral properties would be reducible to just physical brain states and meaningless mechanistic processes.

2\) Knowledge would be impossible, due to the fact that under the atheistic worldview, any mental state of a given human being would just be due to random, blind and undirected physical processes (which would entail that our 'knowledge' is not trustable).

3\) Truth would be impossible, since there is no ultimate truth maker making anything a fact.

2. Claim: If (a loving and all-good) God exists, why is there so much evil in the world?

   Response: Evil existing is a part of His infinite wisdom. If something that is contrastable in meaning exists, then its opposite has to exist, otherwise nothing of the two exists. 

   For example—If the world only knew good, and there was no bad at all, it would entail that the world has no idea of what bad is, therefore the good loses all its meaning since it has no contrast or comparison. 

   Another thing to note is that evil existing leads to a greater good (which has wisdom in it). You cannot be a person of justice (and justice is a good thing) without evil existing. You can’t be forgiving if no one ever wrongs you. You can’t be patient if there is no hardship. The list goes on.

3. Claim: Why can matter not be a necessary being?

   Response: To respond to this claim, we will have to look at two hypotheses and see which one better accounts for reality.

HT: Theism, the thesis that there exists one eternal, omnipotent, omniscient supreme being whose existence is necessary by its own nature.

HN: Multiverse Naturalism, the thesis that there exists a timeless, eternal, immaterial (or material, given the question) nomological generator that infinitely generates multiverses, with its existence not being necessary by its own nature, since it is dependent upon its metaphysically contingent parts (quarks). Now, what is the issue with a quark(s) being a necessary being? There are many quarks, which one is necessary? What would differentiate a quark that is necessary from one that is contingent? If they are all necessary, then we have a problem. Multiple necessary beings would entail a contradiction. If you posit that matter *in general* is a necessary being you are either positing:

1. All individual parts of what constitutes all matter are necessary, which we have stated above as entailing a contradiction, or  
2. Matter as a whole, meaning the concept of matter being a necessary being, in which case it would be an ontological error, since universals (the idea of matter) don’t actually assume an existence extramentally, as opposed to particulars (individual parts).

	  
	Another thing to mention is that under HN, every single event becomes arbitrary, entailing that morality, knowledge and truth are reduced to absurdities and have no meaning. We will get to that in another part.

# **Refuting 200 (or so) Atheistic Arguments** {#refuting-200-(or-so)-atheistic-arguments}

That’s right. 200+ arguments. I’ll try to make it concise. *The red colored text will be the atheistic argument, while the green is my (Tasmim’s) response.*

## Cosmological Arguments For Atheism {#cosmological-arguments-for-atheism}

1. ### Epicurean cosmological arguments for naturalism {#epicurean-cosmological-arguments-for-naturalism}

     
   “The basic line of reasoning is that if being uncreated is a property of matter-energy in the actual world, then it is an *essential* property of matter-energy, in which case matter-energy in the actual world is *essentially* uncreated.  
     
   Yet stronger versions of the argument can go on from what is said above by appealing to a strong version of the principle of sufficient reason to argue that whatever plays the role of being eternal, essentially uncreated, and indestructible does not vary from possible world to possible world. But if not, then matter is a *metaphysically* necessary being.\[2\] On any version of the argument, however, we seem to get the conclusion that the universe requires no external sustaining cause, in which case, *a fortiori*, God is not required to play such a role.”  
     
   The issue is, for something to be metaphysically necessary, it cannot be another way. Matter can definitely be another way. Not only that, but this argument fails to account for *why* cause and effect relationships exist in the material world in the first place. Encyclopedia Britannica defines matter as: *matter, material substance that constitutes the observable universe and, together with energy, forms the basis of all objective phenomena.*

   It is conceivable for matter to be another way that isn’t the current way, and therefore matter is not necessary, but contingent. We do not deny that it is possible for there to be an infinite regress of *events*, as that is possible for Allah the Almighty, but we deny that there can be an infinite regress of *causes*.  
     
   I would also like to mention that “matter-energy” insinuates at least two components that make it necessary, making it dependent on its parts.  
   

2. ### The Big Bang Cosmological Argument for Atheism {#the-big-bang-cosmological-argument-for-atheism}

     
   (1) The big bang singularity is the earliest state of the universe.  
     
   (2) The earliest state of the universe is inanimate  
     
   (2) follows from (1) since the singularity involves the life-hostile conditions of infinite temperature, infinite curvature and infinite density.  
     
   The fourth scientific idea explained in the last section, the principle of ignorance, gives us the summary premise  
     
   (3) No law governs the big bang singularity and consequently there is no guarantee that it will emit a configuration of particles that will evolve into an animate universe.  
     
   (1)-(3) entail  
     
   (4) The earliest state of the universe is not guaranteed to evolve into an animate state of the universe.  
     
   My argument is that (4) is inconsistent with the hypothesis that God created the earliest state of the universe, since it is true of God that if he created the earliest state of the universe, then he would have ensured that this state is animate or evolves into animate states of the universe. It is essential to the idea of God in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition that if he creates a universe, he creates an animate universe, and therefore that if he creates a first state of the universe, he creates a state that is, or is guaranteed to evolve into, an animate state. If somebody says, ‘it does not matter to God whether the universe he creates is animate or inanimate,’ this person is operating with a concept of God that is at odds with classical theism. I think it would be granted by virtually all contemporary theists in the analytic tradition (M. and R. Adams, Craig, Menzel, Morris, Plantinga, Quinn, Schlesinger, Swinburne, Wainwright, Wolterstorff and many others) that God, if he creates a universe, intends his creation to be animate. Richard Swinburne writes, for example, that ‘orderly universes’ are those required by animate creatures and that ‘God has overriding reason to make an orderly universe if he makes a universe at all.  
     
   This argument has a LOOOOOT wrong with it. I’ll mention some points below.

   1\. The argument makes a faulty assumption of what God *is obligated* to do based on their own reasoning.   
   2\. It presupposes that God *needs* to create an animated universe from the start or that it needs the potential to “evolve” (assumes what God *ought* to do). This is a form of begging the question.  
3. Premise 3 is a form of argument from ignorance, since when it talks about “guarantee”, it is speaking from a human perspective. It may not appear guaranteed to us, but it is very well conceivable that God preordained for it to happen. Chance does not assume an ontological existence.  
4. Premise 1 presupposes that the Big Bang Theory is true in the first place. There have been discussions in the field of Philosophy of Science regarding a common fallacy that can be found in scientific inquiry, especially in the fields of evolutionary biology and cosmology (both of which are technically pseudoscience, since they contain theories whose hypotheses aren’t testable).   
   Shaykh Abu Iyaad Amjad Rafiq says “Induction is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as: ‘*The process of inferring a general law or principle from the observation of particular instances.*’ In inductive reasoning, generalisations are made from a limited number of observations. There is a movement from the specific to the general. As a result, inductive reasoning is susceptible to false conclusions.’”  
     
   This fallacy is called “Affirming the Consequent”. Shaykh Abu Iyaad gives an example, one with the basic example of the fallacy and then the fallacy in the context of the Big Bang Cosmology:

   “To illustrate this fallacy consider the following argument:  
     
     
   \- If P (it is raining) is true \[the condition\], then Q (it is wet) is true \[the consequent\].  
   \- P (it is raining) is true \[affirm the condition\].  
   \- Therefore Q (it is wet) is true \[affirm the consequent\].  
     
   It would be useful to illustrate how this fallacy is used in cosmology and evolution.  
     
   In cosmology: If the Big Bang is true, we should see cosmic background radiation. We have detected cosmic background radiation permeating the universe. Therefore, the Big Bang is true. The error here is that detection of background radiation permeating the universe does not prove the Big Bang as other explanations are plausible which have not been exhausted and empirically ruled out. Further, no empirical evidence has been shown that the Big Bang is actually true.”

# **Main notes on Atheistic Philosophy** {#main-notes-on-atheistic-philosophy}

## 

## **1	Epistemology** {#1-epistemology}

1) Epistemology is the study of the nature of knowledge and how we come to know things.

2) First, you should remember that a discussion between an atheist and a muslim is conjecture against self-evident, axiomatic truths.

   

3) A self-evident (or axiomatic) truth is a proposition that requires no evidence to back up its claim. E.g. “The external (physical) world exists and is not a product of the mind or a hallucination.” 

   If one were to respond “I see my hand, therefore it exists”, then a skeptic can just say “When you hallucinate, you also see things. They don’t exist, however.” Granted, the proper response to this is to claim the axiom and that it is a justified belief (that the external, physical world exists).

   Here is another example of a situation where you should claim the axiom: You cannot prove to me that the world was not just created 5 minutes ago, and with us coming into existence 5 minutes ago with fabricated memories. If one were to claim “We have empirical evidence (video, photographs) then the response would just be that the “evidence” itself came into being when the world also came into being 5 minutes ago. Definitively, there is no way to actually prove that we did not just come into existence 5 minutes ago with fabricated memories of the past.

4) Contrary to popular belief, you *can* prove a negative. The law of non-contradiction itself is a negative that is proved. (The Law of Non-Contradiction states that two contradictory propositions *cannot* be true at the same time). Note that the word “cannot” entails that it is a negative claim. Following on from the previous: A positive claim can be turned into a negative claim, by turning it into a double negative. I am a human, which also means I am not a non-human. By this, it necessarily follows that atheists *can* “prove” that there is no god (they’ll never actually be able to, but the intended meaning here is that the burden of proof CAN—and we posit that it DOES—lie upon them).

5) Continuing from point D, who does the burden of proof lie upon, then? It is entirely justifiable to believe that the sum of the universe, being organized, had to have been the product of knowledge, wisdom, will, power, or simply put, choice with intent, or simply put, intentionality (as opposed to “accidental; random” as atheists put it).

6) (work in progress)

## 

## **2	Naturalism and Science** {#2-naturalism-and-science}

1) Shaykh Abu Iyaad Amjad Rafiq (hafidhahullah) mentions that there are two definitions of science at play — one being the scientific method — as in: *observation, theorization, experimentation, collection of data, and making inferences and explanations with impartiality* — and the other being a philosophical, metaphysical position that all observable phenomena can be explained through natural, materialistic causes. As the shaykh mentions, this is really just a philosophical assertion (one that can’t even be proven by the scientific method\!).

2) Naturalism is the philosophical position that everything in the universe can be explained naturally. This would entail that there are no supernatural causes or events (under this position).

3) There have been in-depth discussions in the Philosophy of Science regarding a common problem that the scientific method can fall into when making inductions about events in the distant past that we are not able to empirically verify—the problem of induction. This is also known as the “affirming the consequent” fallacy, and it states that when the consequent (in a set of propositions) comes first, the conclusion is no longer necessarily entailed from the premises (as opposed to a deductive arguments where the antecedent comes first. I’ll give you an example:

   

   If P, then Q.

   P is true, therefore Q.

   

   If it is raining, the ground is wet (by necessity; this is a deductive argument since the antecedent is first).

   

   It is raining.

   Therefore, the ground is wet.

   

   However, if you were to turn the argument around and place the consequent before the antecedent (which is the case with the big bang theory and cosmology in general), you get this:

   

   If P, then Q.

   Q is true.

   

   Therefore, P (took place).

     
   If it is raining, the ground is wet.

   The ground is wet.

   

   Therefore, it rained (by necessity).

   

   As you can see, this is inherently fallacious. When the consequent comes first, the argument converts into an induction (which isn’t based upon certainty) as opposed to deduction (which aims for certainty, and makes absolute claims).

   

## **3	Philosophy of Mind & Metaphysics** {#3-philosophy-of-mind-&-metaphysics}

1) Consciousness is the central topic of the Philosophy of Mind.

2) Dualism is the thesis that there are two fundamental substances in reality — the physical and the immaterial.

3) Monism is the thesis that only one fundamental substance exists in reality. This position is held onto by most atheists (who also are naturalists/materialists).

   Under Monism, there are multiple types:

   **Reductive Physicalism** \- The metaphysical thesis that consciousness is entirely reducible to physical parts or processes in the brain (which can be applied to the entire metaphysical structure of reality, not just consciousness).

**Non-reductive Physicalism** \- The thesis that consciousness is composed of one fundamental substance, being a material substance but that it is not entirely reducible to its physical parts or processes. Proponents of this thesis posit that consciousness in and of itself is a mental property that cannot be identified by its individual parts.

**Neutral Monism** \- \[in progress\]

Of these types, my position, being the athari-islamic position in creed, is indicative of something similar to a property dualist or *non-reductive physicalist*. The reason I say this is, of course, that the soul cannot be a purely immaterial entity or substance, as it has the properties of (spatial) extension (insofar as it takes up space) and localization (insofar as it resides in, permeates and is confined to the body as a very subtle substance), while the substance dualist position would posit that the soul is immaterial, and immateriality entails the lack of spatial extension or localization.

**4	The Truthfulness of A System**

1) This section will focus on how a system of propositions, or beliefs can be true.   
2) In this example, we will use religion: 

   A religion ***R*** is true *if and only if* the set of all propositions made within its system accurately describes reality and its metaphysical structure.

**Memorandum**: Hmmm… So, you made it to this section of the document where all of my disordered ideas are going from now on. Well, let’s start with the basics—what is this document for? To refute atheism, duh. But as of now, I’m thinking of what else to add.

[^1]:  The terms are only going to be defined within the context and practical usage of this paper.
